## Develop strategy and Wireframe

## Miro Board

The Miro Board was the initial tool we used for iteration. The board allowed us to quicky communicate how the over project will be worked on, start until finished, placed all articles and pictures we will be using and the technology that will be used.  


## Balsamiq
Balsamiq was used to design the initial idea of the All Well’s website which entailed all user features, navigation and placeholders for pictures that would be incorporated within the website. We had made minor alterations in the finished project to support user friendliness and responsivness

## Lucid Chart

We decided to create a visual map of the website so we could clearly conceptualise the project as a whole.

## Styling frontend development

Styling font pairing - Raleway & Merriweather. A pastel colour palette of 3 shades of blue/green and beige was used.  The intention for the MVP styling was to convey an identity that was  Lighthearted, "fun" and warm theme to appeal to people of all ages.

We had used, CSS, Bootstrap and HTML for this.

## Fixed Bugs

Summernote stops the display of Event/Article type in Article Admin Screen.

![Old Code](/assets/images/readme/old_code.png)

The code higlighted in the article model above displayed the Event/Article content type on the admin page. This was broken by Summernote.
This functionality is being left in place in case it works somewhere other than the admin panel!

![New Code](/assets/images/readme/new_code.png)

Adding the highlighted code to the Summernote admin class replaced the lost funtionality resulting in the image below.

![Fixed display](/assets/images/readme/fixed_type_display.png)

the missing single quote from this line in logout.html
<p>{% trans 'Are you sure you want to sign out? %}</p>
was causing a "TemplateSyntaxError" at /accounts/logout/ which we had fixed

## Unfixed Bug

In the forms for Comments and Reviews, The text  "Body** appears, we have been unable to find it and remove it.

## Testing

- All top level links works as expected.

- User Account Creation works as expected.
 
- User login and logout works as expected.
